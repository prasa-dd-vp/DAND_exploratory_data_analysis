# Exploratory Data Analysis

  I have chosen "Final contribution for the presidential election 2016" to preform the exploratory data analysis. The analysis is carried out in R Studios. Various insights are found using the univariate, bivariate and multivariate plots. And, under each plots, the results of the analysis is documented. After those three sections, final plots are made to arrive at a conclusion. The final reflection is also well documented. 
  
## Reflection
  Thus I have made an explaratory data analysis on the financial contribution for the presidential election by the state Alaska. The data set contains 22,187 observations and 18 variables. To fully understand the structure of the data set and to unveil the interesting features I started analysing the individiual variables. The intresting features of the data set being the contribution receipt amount. Consequently, the explorations began to be more interesting when the time (Contribution receipt date) gets involved.

Then I started comparing the other different features of the data set with respect to the contribution amount. It gave much more insights. Then I found the top ten observations of some features and compared those among themselves. After that, when the third variable (Contribution receipt date) comes into the play, the insights were very interesting. I explored everything with respect to the time. Thus, I can understand, though Hillary Clinton contributed the highest amount, Donald J Trump contributed more amount in a lesser period of time.

The limitations of this exploration being that, I cannot come to a conclusion that who contributed the more as a whole from this dataset because it contains onlt the details of the state Alaska. And, in the future work, I can explore further with the dataset including all the states of the United States and arrive at a conclusion.
